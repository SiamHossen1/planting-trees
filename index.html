    <div class="box1">
        <p>Trees are vital. As the biggest plants on the planet, they give us oxygen, store carbon, stabilise the soil and give life to the world’s wildlife. They also provide us with the materials for tools and shelter.
        Not only are trees essential for life, but as the longest living species on earth, they give us a link between the past, present and future. 
        Over 20 species of British trees and shrubs are known to have medicinal properties. The oil from birch bark.

        <p>
            It’s critical that woodlands, rainforests and trees in urban settings, such as parks, are preserved and sustainably managed across the world.
            Trees absorb carbon dioxide as they grow and the carbon that they store in their wood helps slow the rate of global warming.
            They reduce wind speeds and cool the air as they lose moisture and reflect heat upwards from their leaves. It’s estimated that trees can reduce the temperature in a city by up to 7°C.
